System 47 Delay Loader for Multiple Monitors
Written by Kris Craig.  09.14.2011.

INSTALLATION
-------------

1. You should be using UltraMon, DisplayFusion, or some other application that allows different screensavers on each monitor.  
Otherwise, there's really no point to this, is there?

	->I personally recommend UltraMon.  It's cheap, but if you don't want to pay for it, you can get it easily on 
	the Pirate Bay.

2. If you haven't already, download and install System 47.  It's on the Google.

3. Locate the loader screensaver file at:  (loader path)\System47_MultiMon\bin\Release\System47_MultiMon.scr

4. Copy that file to the appropriate Windows system directory:

	->For 32-bit systems:  %systemroot%\System32
	->For 64-bit systems:  %systemroot%\SysWOW64

5. Open your UltraMon (or whatever multi-monitor management utility you're using) and configure the screensaver settings.

6. For each monitor you want this on (I'm assuming it's at least 2), select "System47_MultiMon".

	->If an empty command-prompt window opens when you do this, just close it (otherwise the screensaver will activate 
	and send you to the locked desktop screen afterwards).  This is a bug caused by the fact that I just created a 
	basic .exe file and renamed it to .scr.  When I get time later, I'll add some code to make it standards-compliant.  
	But for now, it'll at least do what you want it to do.  =)
