System 47 Delay Loader for Multiple Monitors
Written by Kris Craig.  09.14.2011.

This loader is designed to improve the performance 
of the System 47 screensaver on multiple monitors by 
loading each instance with a random delay.  This will 
cause System 47 to generate a different random seed in 
each instance, which in turn will allow each monitor to 
display a different LCARS sequence instead of them all 
displaying the exact same one.  This adds some awesome 
realism to the effect.

See the included WTFPLv3.txt file for license information.  
Since System 47 itself does not have a permissive open 
source license, you will have to download and install 
it separately.
